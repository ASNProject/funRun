# FUNRUN APP

## Description

This application is developed to facilitate the scanning of barcodes for participants in running events. When a participant's barcode is scanned, the app instantly processes and displays their information on a dedicated tab screen. The displayed details include the participantâ€™s unique number, full name, and initials, allowing event organizers or staff to quickly verify and manage participant data in real-time. The tab-based interface ensures easy navigation and clear visibility of all scanned participants, enhancing efficiency during event check-ins or monitoring.
